Welcome! I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student (08/2024 - ) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where my advisor is Prof. [Narendra Ahuja](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=dY7OSl0AAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I was fortunate to work with [Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kindrtnk) during my master's program at UIUC. <span style="color:red">I am seeking full-time Research intern opportunities in the 2026 summer. Happy to discuss potential fits.</span> <be>
